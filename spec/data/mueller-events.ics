DESCRIPTION:Barr submitted to Congress a four-page summary of Mueller's pri
 ncipal conclusions. Barr indicated that Mueller found that the evidence did
  not establish that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign conspired 
 with Russia to interfere in the election. Barr said that Mueller  conducted
  a thorough finding of facts related to the issue of whether Trump had comm
 itted obstruction of justice but ultimately did not make a traditional reco
 mmendation as to whether to prosecute the president. In his report\, Barr i
 ndicated that Mueller wrote\, "while this report does not conclude that the
  President committed a crime\, it also does not exonerate home." Barr told 
 Congress that he and Rosenstein did not believe there was sufficient eviden
 ce to accuse Trump of obstruction.
